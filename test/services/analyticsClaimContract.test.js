// when they were spoken, and insightsSyncEnabled is device-scoped and survives
// sign-out while sign-out clears only isSignedIn. A claim inside the sync path
// therefore reads as: user A signs out, dictates, user B signs in, and B's
// first pass uploads A's counters into B's account -- unrevocably, since this
// client never calls the cloud's analytics delete route. The claim must stay
// where the user is actually asked (useInsightsSyncOptIn's dialog).
